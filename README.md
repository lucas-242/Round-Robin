# Round-Robin
The algorithm aims to create a simple representation of processes in the Round Robin scheduling. It was developed to be presented in college.

There are two folders, in one there is the algorithm working correctly without system interruptions and in the other an algorithm that tries to simulate the interrupts.

The algorithm that simulates system interrupts was not done correctly because it does not use multiple threads.
Since I could not find a way to better simulate interrupts, the algorithm always tries to throw two interrupts randomly while executing a process.

Maybe in the future I'll come back to try to implement the interrupts correctly.
